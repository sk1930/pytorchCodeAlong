03 Implementing CNNs with PyTorch
=================================
Trained a convolutional neural network model using PyTorch on cats_dogs image data set from kaggale. Applied various transformations -  resize, centercrop, horizontal flipping, normalization on the data to increase the size of the data set. Made modifications to pretrained AlexNet model from PyTorch models to predict two categories and achieved an accuracy of 97%.
